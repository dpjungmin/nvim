# Installation for macOS

Install my [dotfiles](https://github.com/dpjungmin/dotfiles). This will auto-install all my
configurations including my Neovim setup and its dependencies.

When you first run `nvim`, [packer] will be installed. After [packer] is installed re-start `nvim`
and run `:PackerSync` to install all packages.

This is currently WIP.

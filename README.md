# Installation for macOS and Arch Linux

Install my [dotfiles](https://github.com/dpjungmin/dotfiles). This will
auto-install all my configurations including my Neovim setup and its
dependencies.

When you first run `nvim`, [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
will be installed. After packer is installed re-start `nvim` and run
`:PackerSync` to install all packages.

This is currently WIP.
